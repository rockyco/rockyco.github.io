# About Jie LEI

I am a Research Fellow at the University of Technology Sydney, specializing in deploying algorithms on FPGAs more efficiently through algorithm-hardware co-design and Matlab to HLS conversion.

## Research Philosophy

My work bridges the gap between high-level algorithm design and efficient hardware implementation. I believe that the future of computing lies in specialized hardware accelerators that can execute complex algorithms with optimal performance and energy efficiency.

## Expertise Areas

### FPGA Prototyping
Developing efficient FPGA implementations for complex algorithms, with focus on optimization techniques that maximize performance while minimizing resource utilization.

### High Level Synthesis
Converting high-level algorithm descriptions (particularly from Matlab) to optimized hardware implementations using HLS tools and methodologies.

### Wireless Communications Systems
Designing and implementing signal processing algorithms for modern wireless communication systems, with emphasis on real-time hardware realization.

### Image Processing
Hardware-accelerated image and signal processing algorithms, focusing on real-time processing capabilities for demanding applications.

## Career Journey

With over a decade of academic experience, I have progressed from Associate Professor to Professor at Xidian University before joining UTS as a Research Fellow. My international experience includes a visiting scholar position at UCLA, which broadened my research perspective and collaborative network.

## Research Impact

My research contributes to making complex algorithms more accessible through efficient hardware implementation, enabling real-world applications that were previously computationally prohibitive.

## Current Focus

At UTS, I am working on cutting-edge research in FPGA-based algorithm deployment, developing new methodologies for algorithm-hardware co-design that will shape the future of specialized computing systems.
